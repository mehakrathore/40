Implement Pagination and Sorting for Book API

Overview: 

In our full-stack book management application, we are providing users with the ability to paginate through the list of books and sort them based on specific criteria. To achieve this, we have enhanced our API endpoints to support query parameters for pagination, page size, and sorting.

Summary:

This implementation covers a basic full-stack book management system with pagination and sorting features. The backend, built with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB, handles the CRUD operations, pagination, and sorting. The frontend, developed with React, provides a user interface for interacting with the backend, displaying paginated and sortable book lists.

Running the Project:

1. Backend:
   Navigate to the 'backend' directory.
   Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
   Create a '.env' file with your MongoDB URI.
   Run 'npm start' to start the server.

2. Frontend:
   Navigate to the 'frontend' directory.
   Run 'npm install' to install dependencies.
   Create a '.env' file with the API URL.
   Run 'npm start' to start the React app.
